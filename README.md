# Reddit API

## Summary

This project was inspired by a web programming course I took at John Abbott College, however this was my way of learning prominent JavaScript libraries such as Express (to build the actual REST API), Prisma (open source ORM) and JWT for authentication. 

This project isn't entirely complete, I would like to continue working on authentication going forward and modify the contents of the payload sent from the server. 

If you would like to see how the routes work, please navigate to the server's entry point.

Once your environment variables are set based off the .env.example, you can simply run npm start to serve the API.
